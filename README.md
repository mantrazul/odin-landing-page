## **What's this?**

This is part project to learn CSS/HTML in the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). Basically, the goal will be to build a _landing page_ from the ground up using my current HTML/CSS skills and the template provided by Odin.

## **Template**

<br />

<img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png" alt="a standard template of a site with a nav bar, a header, a content section, call up for action and a footer" width="300"/> <img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png" alt="a reference of fonts, sizes to help with the project" width="300" height ="398"/>
